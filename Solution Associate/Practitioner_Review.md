## **AWS Infrastructure Concepts**

### *AWS Regions*

> Geographic location where Amazon Web Services (AWS) operates a cluster of data centers. Each region is a completely isolated infrastructure and includes multiple Availability Zones, which are distinct data centers that are interconnected with high-bandwidth, low-latency networking.

### *Availability Zones*

> A single data center or group of data centers within a region, each with redunant power, networking and connectivity, housed in separate facilities

### *Edge Locations*

> A site that Amazon CloudFront uses to store cached copies of your content closer to your customers for faster delivery.

## **Core AWS Services**

* *COMPUTE*: Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

* *DATABASE*: Relation Database Service (RDS) and DynamoDB

* *STORAGE*: Simple Storage Service (S3)

* *NETWORKING*: Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

* *SECURITY*: Identity and Access Management (IAM)

## **Working with AWS**

### *AWS Management Console*

> AWS Management Console is a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with various AWS services and resources in a visual way. With the Management Console, users can manage their AWS infrastructure, deploy applications, and monitor performance, among other tasks. The Console provides an easy-to-use interface for managing AWS resources, making it a popular tool for users who prefer a visual approach to AWS.

### *Software Developer Kit (SDK)*

> Software Developer Kit (SDK) is a collection of libraries and tools that allow developers to interact with AWS services programmatically using popular programming languages such as Java, Python, .NET, and Ruby. The SDK provides a set of APIs, sample code, and documentation that enables developers to build applications that can access AWS services and resources, such as EC2, S3, and DynamoDB. This helps to streamline the development process and reduces the need for developers to write code from scratch.

### *Command Line Interface (CLI)*

> Command Line Interface (CLI) is a command-line tool that allows users to interact with AWS services from a terminal or command prompt. The CLI provides a set of commands that can be used to perform various tasks, such as creating and managing AWS resources, deploying applications, and monitoring performance. The CLI is a powerful tool for automation and scripting and can be used to integrate AWS with other tools and applications.

### *AWS Cloudshell*

> AWS Cloudshell is an interactive, browser-based shell environment that provides access to a pre-configured CLI and other tools for managing AWS resources. CloudShell runs on AWS infrastructure and provides a secure, isolated environment for users to run commands and scripts against their AWS resources. CloudShell includes a pre-installed set of tools, such as AWS CLI, Git, and Python, among others, making it a convenient tool for users who need to perform AWS management tasks on-the-go without the need for local installations.
